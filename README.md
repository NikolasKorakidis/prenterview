### Welcome to PreInterview App.

We are team Lead and we are three students of Codaisseur 🚀 !
As part of the final Group Project we matched randomly to deliver a project based on Typescript in 4 days!
The idea behind PreInterview is that you can build something simple and good looking but also usefull and functional with "An app for developer who are looking for a job" Theme.

**So waht is this App about?**

Our App is focus for the person just before an interview. Literally. Just before you walk in!

- You can check the most important things before you walk in
- Depends on how you feel you get a motivational Quote to keep you going
- Depends on your heart rate you can have some breathing exercises to relax before you step inside the arena of jobsearch!

**How did we worked as a team...:**

- 🌱 We started "mob programming" with 30 minutes turns and Mobster on for the main structure of the App and the basic Styling.
- 👨🏽‍💻 We seperated our App individually in three branches and merged them to the main App.
- 🌱 Finally we Mobbed for the last part and polished the App in turns!
- 💬 The communication was through Discord and we worked remote!
